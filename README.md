[django-notifications](https://github.com/django-notifications/django-notifications) is a GitHub notification alike app for Django, it was derived from [django-activity-stream](https://github.com/justquick/django-activity-stream)

The major difference between `django-notifications` and `django-activity-stream`:

- `django-notifications` is for building something like Github "Notifications"
- While `django-activity-stream` is for building Github "News Feed"

Notifications are actually actions events, which are categorized by four main components.

-   `Actor`. The object that performed the activity.
-   `Verb`. The verb phrase that identifies the action of the activity.
-   `Action Object`. *(Optional)* The object linked to the action
    itself.
-   `Target`. *(Optional)* The object to which the activity was
    performed.

`Actor`, `Action Object` and `Target` are `GenericForeignKeys` to any
arbitrary Django object. An action is a description of an action that
was performed (`Verb`) at some instant in time by some `Actor` on some
optional `Target` that results in an `Action Object` getting
created/updated/deleted.

For example: [justquick](https://github.com/justquick/) `(actor)`
*closed* `(verb)` [issue
2](https://github.com/justquick/django-activity-stream/issues/2)
`(action_object)` on
[activity-stream](https://github.com/justquick/django-activity-stream/)
`(target)` 12 hours ago

Nomenclature of this specification is based on the Activity Streams
Spec: <http://activitystrea.ms/specs/atom/1.0/>

## Requirements

-   Python 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11
-   Django 3.2, 4.0, 4.1

## Installation

Installation is easy using `pip` and will install all required
libraries.
```bash
$ pip install django-notifications-hq
```
or get it from source

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/django-notifications/django-notifications
$ cd django-notifications
$ python setup.py sdist
$ pip install dist/django-notifications-hq*
```

Note that [django-model-utils](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-model-utils)
will be installed: this is required for the pass-through QuerySet manager.

Then to add the Django Notifications to your project add the app
`notifications` to your `INSTALLED_APPS` and urlconf.

The app should go somewhere after all the apps that are going to be
generating notifications like `django.contrib.auth`

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = (
    'django.contrib.auth',
    ...
    'notifications',
    ...
)
```

Add the notifications urls to your urlconf:

```python
import notifications.urls

urlpatterns = [
    ...
    url('^inbox/notifications/', include(notifications.urls, namespace='notifications')),
    ...
]
```

The method of installing these urls, importing rather than using
`'notifications.urls'`, is required to ensure that the urls are
installed in the `notifications` namespace.

To run schema migration, execute
`python manage.py migrate notifications`.

## Generating Notifications

Generating notifications is probably best done in a separate signal.

```python
from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from notifications.signals import notify
from myapp.models import MyModel

def my_handler(sender, instance, created, **kwargs):
    notify.send(instance, verb='was saved')

post_save.connect(my_handler, sender=MyModel)
```
To generate an notification anywhere in your code, simply import the
notify signal and send it with your actor, recipient, and verb.

```python
from notifications.signals import notify

notify.send(user, recipient=user, verb='you reached level 10')
```

The complete syntax is.

```python
notify.send(actor, recipient, verb, action_object, target, level, description, public, timestamp, **kwargs)
```

Arguments:

-   **actor**: An object of any type. (Required) Note: Use
    **sender** instead of **actor** if you intend to use keyword
    arguments
-   **recipient**: A **Group** or a **User QuerySet** or a list of
    **User**. (Required)
-   **verb**: An string. (Required)
-   **action\_object**: An object of any type. (Optional)
-   **target**: An object of any type. (Optional)
-   **level**: One of Notification.LEVELS (\'success\', \'info\',
    \'warning\', \'error\') (default=info). (Optional)
-   **description**: An string. (Optional)
-   **public**: An boolean (default=True). (Optional)
-   **timestamp**: An tzinfo (default=timezone.now()). (Optional)

### Extra data

You can attach arbitrary data to your notifications by doing the
following:

-   Add to your settings.py:
    `DJANGO_NOTIFICATIONS_CONFIG = { 'USE_JSONFIELD': True}`

Then, any extra arguments you pass to `notify.send(...)` will be
attached to the `.data` attribute of the notification object. These will
be serialised using the JSONField\'s serialiser, so you may need to take
that into account: using only objects that will be serialised is a good
idea.

### Soft delete

By default, `delete/(?P<slug>\d+)/` deletes specified notification
record from DB. You can change this behaviour to \"mark
`Notification.deleted` field as `True`\" by:

-   Add to your settings.py:
    `DJANGO_NOTIFICATIONS_CONFIG = { 'SOFT_DELETE': True}`

With this option, QuerySet methods `unread` and `read` contain one more
filter: `deleted=False`. Meanwhile, QuerySet methods `deleted`,
`active`, `mark_all_as_deleted`, `mark_all_as_active` are turned on. See
more details in QuerySet methods section.

## API

### QuerySet methods

Using `django-model-utils`, we get the ability to add queryset methods
to not only the manager, but to all querysets that will be used,
including related objects. This enables us to do things like:

```python
    Notification.objects.unread()
```

which returns all unread notifications. To do this for a single user, we
can do:

```python
    user = User.objects.get(pk=pk)
    user.notifications.unread()
```

There are some other QuerySet methods, too.

#### `qs.unsent()`

Return all of the unsent notifications, filtering the current queryset.
(emailed=False)

#### `qs.sent()`

Return all of the sent notifications, filtering the current queryset.
(emailed=True)

#### `qs.unread()`

Return all of the unread notifications, filtering the current queryset.
When `SOFT_DELETE=True`, this filter contains `deleted=False`.

#### `qs.read()`

Return all of the read notifications, filtering the current queryset.
When `SOFT_DELETE=True`, this filter contains `deleted=False`.

#### `qs.mark_all_as_read()` \| `qs.mark_all_as_read(recipient)`

Mark all of the unread notifications in the queryset (optionally also
filtered by `recipient`) as read.

#### `qs.mark_all_as_unread()` \| `qs.mark_all_as_unread(recipient)`

Mark all of the read notifications in the queryset (optionally also
filtered by `recipient`) as unread.

#### `qs.mark_as_sent()` \| `qs.mark_as_sent(recipient)`

Mark all of the unsent notifications in the queryset (optionally also
filtered by `recipient`) as sent.

#### `qs.mark_as_unsent()` \| `qs.mark_as_unsent(recipient)`

Mark all of the sent notifications in the queryset (optionally also
filtered by `recipient`) as unsent.

#### `qs.deleted()`

Return all notifications that have `deleted=True`, filtering the current
queryset. Must be used with `SOFT_DELETE=True`.

#### `qs.active()`

Return all notifications that have `deleted=False`, filtering the
current queryset. Must be used with `DELETE=True`.

#### `qs.mark_all_as_deleted()` \| `qs.mark_all_as_deleted(recipient)`

Mark all notifications in the queryset (optionally also filtered by
`recipient`) as `deleted=True`. Must be used with `DELETE=True`.

#### `qs.mark_all_as_active()` \| `qs.mark_all_as_active(recipient)`

Mark all notifications in the queryset (optionally also filtered by
`recipient`) as `deleted=False`. Must be used with `SOFT_DELETE=True`.

### Model methods

#### `obj.timesince([datetime])`

A wrapper for Django\'s `timesince` function.

#### `obj.mark_as_read()`

Mark the current object as read.

### Template tags

Put `{% load notifications\_tags %}` in the template before
you actually use notification tags.

### `notifications_unread`

```python
    {% notifications_unread %}
```

Give the number of unread notifications for a user, or nothing (an empty
string) for an anonymous user.

Storing the count in a variable for further processing is advised, such
as:

```python
    {% notifications_unread as unread_count %}
    ...
    {% if unread_count %}
        You have <strong>{{ unread_count }}</strong> unread notifications.
    {% endif %}
```

## Live-updater API

To ensure users always have the most up-to-date notifications,
`django-notifications` includes a simple javascript API for
updating specific fields within a django template.

There are two possible API calls that can be made:

1.  `api/unread_count/` that returns a javascript object with 1 key:
    `unread_count` eg:

        {"unread_count":1}

2.  `api/unread_list/` that returns a javascript object with 2 keys:
    `unread_count` and `unread_list` eg:

        {
         "unread_count":1,
         "unread_list":[--list of json representations of notifications--]
        }

    Representations of notifications are based on the django method:
    `model_to_dict`

    Query string arguments:

    -   **max** - maximum length of unread list.
    -   **mark\_as\_read** - mark notification in list as read.

    For example, get `api/unread_list/?max=3&mark_as_read=true` returns
    3 notifications and mark them read (remove from list on next
    request).

### How to use:

1.  Put `{% load notifications_tags %}` in the template before you
    actually use notification tags.

2.  In the area where you are loading javascript resources add the
    following tags in the order below:

        <script src="{% static 'notifications/notify.js' %}" type="text/javascript"></script>
        {% register_notify_callbacks callbacks='fill_notification_list,fill_notification_badge' %}

    `register_notify_callbacks` takes the following arguments:

    1.  `badge_class` (default `live_notify_badge`) - The identifier
        `class` of the element to show the unread count,
        that will be periodically updated.
    2.  `menu_class` (default `live_notify_list`) - The identifier
        `class` of the element to insert a list of unread
        items, that will be periodically updated.
    3.  `refresh_period` (default `15`) - How often to fetch unread
        items from the server (integer in seconds).
    4.  `fetch` (default `5`) - How many notifications to fetch each
        time.
    5.  `callbacks` (default `<empty string>`) - A comma-separated list
        of javascript functions to call each period.
    6.  `api_name` (default `list`) - The name of the API to call (this
        can be either `list` or `count`).
    7. ``mark_as_read`` (default ``False``) - Marks notifications as read when fetched.

3.  To insert a live-updating unread count, use the following template:

        {% live_notify_badge %}

    `live_notify_badge` takes the following arguments:

    -  `badge_class` (default `live_notify_badge`) - The identifier
        `class` for the `<span>` element that will be created to show
        the unread count.

4.  To insert a live-updating unread list, use the following template:

        {% live_notify_list %}

    `live_notify_list` takes the following arguments:

    -  `list_class` (default `live_notify_list`) - The identifier
        `class` for the `<ul>` element that will be created to insert
        the list of notifications into.

### Using the live-updater with bootstrap

The Live-updater can be incorporated into bootstrap with minimal code.

To create a live-updating bootstrap badge containing the unread count,
simply use the template tag:

    {% live_notify_badge badge_class="badge" %}

To create a live-updating bootstrap dropdown menu containing a selection
of recent unread notifications, simply use the template tag:

    {% live_notify_list list_class="dropdown-menu" %}

### Customising the display of notifications using javascript callbacks

While the live notifier for unread counts should suit most use cases,
users may wish to alter how unread notifications are shown.

The `callbacks` argument of the `register_notify_callbacks` dictates
which javascript functions are called when the unread api call is made.

To add a custom javascript callback, simply add this to the list, like
so:

    {% register_notify_callbacks callbacks='fill_notification_badge,my_special_notification_callback' %}

The above would cause the callback to update the unread count badge, and
would call the custom function
`my_special_notification_callback`. All callback
functions are passed a single argument by convention called
`data`, which contains the entire result from the API.

For example, the below function would get the recent list of unread
messages and log them to the console:

```javascript
function my_special_notification_callback(data) {
    for (var i=0; i < data.unread_list.length; i++) {
        msg = data.unread_list[i];
        console.log(msg);
    }
}
```

### Testing the live-updater

1.  Clone the repo
2.  Run `./manage.py runserver`
3.  Browse to `yourserverip/test/`
4.  Click \'Make a notification\' and a new notification should appear
    in the list in 5-10 seconds.

## Serializing the django-notifications Model

See here - <http://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/relations/#generic-relationships>

In this example the target object can be of type Foo or Bar and the
appropriate serializer will be used.

```python
class GenericNotificationRelatedField(serializers.RelatedField):

    def to_representation(self, value):
        if isinstance(value, Foo):
            serializer = FooSerializer(value)
        if isinstance(value, Bar):
            serializer = BarSerializer(value)

        return serializer.data


class NotificationSerializer(serializers.Serializer):
    recipient = PublicUserSerializer(User, read_only=True)
    unread = serializers.BooleanField(read_only=True)
    target = GenericNotificationRelatedField(read_only=True)
```

### `AbstractNotification` model

In case you need to customize the notification model in order to add
field or customised features that depend on your application, you can
inherit and extend the `AbstractNotification` model, example:

```python
#In your_app/models.py

from django.db import models
from notifications.base.models import AbstractNotification


class Notification(AbstractNotification):
    # custom field example
    category = models.ForeignKey('myapp.Category',
                                 on_delete=models.CASCADE)

    class Meta(AbstractNotification.Meta):
        abstract = False
```

You will require to define `NOTIFICATIONS_NOTIFICATION_MODEL` setting in
`setting.py` as follows:

```python
# In your_project/settings.py

NOTIFICATIONS_NOTIFICATION_MODEL = 'your_app.Notification'
```

## Notes

### Email Notification

Sending email to users has not been integrated into this library. So for
now you need to implement it if needed. There is a reserved field
`Notification.emailed` to make it easier.

### Sample App

A sample app has been implemented in
`notifications/tests/sample_notifications` that extends
`django-notifications` with the sole purpose of testing its
extensibility. You can run the SAMPLE APP by setting the environment
variable `SAMPLE_APP` as follows

```bash
export SAMPLE_APP=1
# Run the Django development server with sample_notifications app installed
python manage.py runserver
# Unset SAMPLE_APP to remove sample_notifications app from list of INSTALLED_APPS
unset SAMPLE_APP
```
